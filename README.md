# ajax-datatables-rails

Datatables is a nifty jquery plugin that adds the ability to paginate, sort, and search your html tables. When dealing with large tables (more than a couple hundred rows) however, we run into performance issues. These can be fixed by using server-side pagination, but this breaks some datatables functionality.

`ajax-datatables-rails` is a wrapper around datatable's ajax methods that allow synchronization with server-side pagination in a rails app. 

## Installation
